      <description>Data Science Skin Cancer detection using Convolution Neural Networks based model: Project Overview   I have used a pre trained model using Transfer-learning and all the model building is based on custom model Objective is to identify the image belongs to which class there are 9 classes in total used sgd as optimiser and evaluated on accuracy as metric Finding the class imbalance is present or not if present treating it with data Augmentation  Code and Resources Used   Python Version: 3.</description>

      <description>Data Science Telecom churn prediction: Project Overview   Recommend strategies to manage customer churn Handling Multi-collinearity in logistic regression Optimized PCA and Logistic Regression, Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model  Code and Resources Used  **Python Version:**3.7 Packages: Pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn
Data Cleaning  After importing data and reading it found that there are many missing values in the data
 Replacing NaN values in categorical variables with -1 where it become a new category Dropped variables with more than a given threshold of missing values Imputing missing values using MICE  EDA   Up on univariate analysis find that most of the data is skewed to wards left  Bivariate EDA  Capped outliers in all numeric variables with K-sigma technique  Model Building  First I divided the data into traintestsplit and then aggregated the categorical columns</description>

      <description>Data Science Lead Scoring Case Study: Project Overview   Created a logistic regression model that helps in identifying potential lead conversion rate to organisation Optimized model to provide 92% on test accuracy  Code and Resources Used  Python Version: 3.7 Packages: Pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodel
Data Cleaning:   Replacing select in data with NaN as these were the category were customer selected nothing which means a NaN object Dropping records which has no use for analysis Calculated percentage of misiisng values and treated with mean imputation for certain columns Inspected numerical columns for outliers and capped to 99 percentile  EDA  I looked at the distribution of data and tried to identify the most important feature in the columns that well explains the leads as well as conversion of customers</description>

      <description>Data Science Clustering Models: project Overview   performed data cleaning operation Outlier and missing value treatments Finding no&amp;rsquo;of clusters using Silhoutte Score Built model with both K-means clustering and heirarchical clustering and compared both the results  Code and Resources Used  Python Version: 3.7 Packages: Pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, scipy
Data Cleaning   Data Quality checks on columns like exports and imports Rounding of the numbers to 2 decimal points for ease of analysis  EDA   Checking for missing values Outlier identification and capping the upper quartile to 99th percentile Univariate and bivariate analysis  burundi has the low income as per primary analysis and can be a country in desire need of aid  Model Building   Before starting clustering the data first i have started with hopkins score to see the cluster tendensy Acheived result of hopkins score: 0.</description>

      <description>Exploratory Data Analysis on Bank Loan Applications: Project Overview   Identify the patterns which indicates if a client has difficulty paying their installments Understanding the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default Finding consumer attributes and loan atrribites influence the tendency of default  Code and Resources Used  python version: 3.7 Packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
Data Cleaning   Identifying missing values in the data dropping records which having more than 30% mising values making days columns to positive using abs() function Changing the type of the numeric columns from object to int Imputing missing values with mean of that columns created age column with use of days_birth to represent age in terms of  EDA  Univariate Analysis categorical - categorical</description>
